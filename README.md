# Golang-based Simple Note-taking API

The Golang-based Simple Note-taking API is a project that allows for the development of a RESTful API in Golang. The API provides basic CRUD operations for notes, with each note containing an ID, title, and content. It uses an in-memory data store using a Go map for note storage, making it easy to manage notes without needing to set up a complex database system.

Additionally, the application is containerized using Docker for easy packaging and deployment, and deployment is managed by Kubernetes and Terraform, which automate the infrastructure deployment and management process. This project provides an opportunity to learn Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform and gain hands-on experience with developing and deploying a RESTful API using these technologies.

## Features

- Basic CRUD operations for notes (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Each note contains an ID, title, and content
- In-memory data store using Go map
- Containerization using Docker
- Deployment with Kubernetes and Terraform

## Goals

The Golang-based Simple Note-taking API project aims to achieve the following goals:

- Develop practical experience with Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform by developing a RESTful API.
- Understand CRUD operations for notes, each of which contains an ID, title, and content.
- Learn how to use an in-memory data store using a Go map for note storage, rather than needing to set up a complex database system.
- Practice containerization of an application using Docker, making it easier to package and deploy.
- Gain hands-on experience with managing the deployment of the application using Kubernetes and Terraform.
- Showcase proficiency in these technologies to potential employers.
